what is array?
------------------
array is special type of variable in which we can store multiple values.
we can access specific value as well as we can also change specific value in array.
to change,access any value in array we have to use array name and its  position known as index which start from 0 and ends on size - 1 where size is the size of the array that we must give when we create an array.
we can change (increse/decrease) size of the array. we must give datatype of the array when we create array. 

how to create array 
datatype array-name[size]

example 
int marks[14]
float weights[7]

how to store value into array 
--------------------------------------
example 
let us store first subject marks 
scanf("%d",&marks[0]);

let us display first subject marks 
printf("first subject mark = %d",marks[0])

how to change variable's value 
marks[0] = 100; 

we can use variable of integer type to give index in all above example 
for example 
int index = 0;
printf("first subject mark = %d",marks[index])


there are mainly two type of array 
single dimensional array 
two dimensional array
